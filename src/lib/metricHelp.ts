      "Score is a probability from 0 to 1 (shown here as a percent). Higher means more likely exploitation activity soon.",
      "It is not severity — that is CVSS. A critical CVE can have a low EPSS, and a moderate CVE can have a high EPSS.",

      "Proof-of-Concept — public PoC code exists; no reliable reports of real-world attacks yet.",
